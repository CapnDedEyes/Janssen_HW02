Difficulties:

- Could not automatically destroy Audio Clips while in the editor because of how the AudioHelper is structured
- I have no idea how I'm supposed to implement something as simple as a divider in the custom editor
- I couldn't fully understand what I was supposed to do from the entry in Unity's official API Manual
